Do at least ONE of the following tasks: refactor is mandatory. Write tests is optional, will be good bonus to see it. 
Upload your results to a Github repo, for easier sharing and reviewing.

Thank you and good luck!



Code to refactor
=================
1) app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php
2) app/Repository/BookingRepository.php

Code to write tests (optional)
=====================
3) App/Helpers/TeHelper.php method willExpireAt
4) App/Repository/UserRepository.php, method createOrUpdate


----------------------------

What I expect in your repo:

X. A readme with:   Your thoughts about the code. What makes it amazing code. Or what makes it ok code. Or what makes it terrible code. How would you have done it. Thoughts on formatting, structure, logic.. The more details that you can provide about the code (what's terrible about it or/and what is good about it) the easier for us to assess your coding style, mentality etc

And 

Y.  Refactor it if you feel it needs refactoring. The more love you put into it. The easier for us to asses your thoughts, code principles etc


IMPORTANT: Make two commits. First commit with original code. Second with your refactor so we can easily trace changes. 


NB: you do not need to set up the code on local and make the web app run. It will not run as its not a complete web app. This is purely to assess you thoughts about code, formatting, logic etc


===== So expected output is a GitHub link with either =====

1. Readme described above (point X above) + refactored code 
OR
2. Readme described above (point X above) + refactored core + a unit test of the code that we have sent

Thank you!


===== Hamood's Thoughts ======

1. app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php
Strengths
=========
The controller demonstrates good use of dependency injection, particularly by injecting the BookingRepository in the constructor.
There's a clear adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle, with the controller focusing on its core responsibilities.

Areas for Improvement
======================
- Localization: 
    The absence of string literal translations suggests that localization may not be implemented. 
    Consider incorporating Laravel's localization features to improve internationalization support.
- Exception Handling and Logging: 
    Enhance the robustness of the application by implementing comprehensive exception handling and logging. 
    This will facilitate easier debugging and maintenance.
- Input Validation: 
    While some methods employ input validation, it's not consistently applied across all methods. 
    Implement thorough input validation throughout the controller, preferably using Laravel's form request validation.
- Consistent API Response Structure: 
    Establish and maintain a uniform JSON response structure across all methods. 
    This will improve scalability and ease of integration for API consumers.
- Utilization of Laravel Helpers: 
    Make full use of Laravel's built-in helpers and facades. For instance, consider using the Carbon facade 
    for date manipulation instead of PHP's native date() function.

2. app/Repository/BookingRepository.php
Areas for Improvement
====================
- Code Organization: 
    The repository file is excessively long. Consider refactoring it into multiple 
    files based on functionality (e.g., separate classes for Notifications, SMS, Emails).
- Code Consistency: 
    The coding style appears to vary throughout the file, suggesting multiple contributors 
    with different coding practices. Establish and adhere to a consistent coding style guide.
- N+1 Query Problem: 
    Several sections of the code contain database queries inside loops, particularly instances of Job::find($v->id). 
    This creates an N+1 query problem, which can severely impact performance as the dataset grows.
- String Constants: 
    Numerous string literals (e.g., 'male', 'female', 'pending') are used throughout the code. 
    Move these to a centralized constants file to improve maintainability and reduce the risk of typos.
- Error Handling: 
    Similar to the controller, the repository lacks comprehensive error handling. 
    Implement try-catch blocks and appropriate error responses to improve robustness.
- Default Values and Edge Cases: 
    Ensure all possible scenarios are accounted for in conditional statements. 
    For instance, when checking user types, include an 'else' condition to handle unexpected cases.
- Database Integrity: 
    Review the management of default values in the database schema. 
    Ensure that the application handles scenarios where expected default values might be missing.

Recommendations
===============
- Refactor the repository into smaller, more focused classes.
- Implement a coding style guide and ensure all team members adhere to it.
- Create a constants file for commonly used string values.
- Address the N+1 query problem by implementing eager loading or query optimization techniques.
- Enhance error handling and logging throughout the repository.
- Review and update conditional logic to account for all possible scenarios.
